![testmachinery diagram overview](https://github.com/gardener/test-infra/raw/master/docs/test_machinary_overview.png)

Read the [design draft here](docs/DesignDraft.md).

The TestMachinery is a k8s controller that watches a k8s cluster for `Testrun`s and executes the tests in the specified order as an argo workflow.

`TestRun`s reference tests by name or label in the `testrun.spec.testflow`. An additional exit flow can be specified in `testrun.spec.onExit`. The exit flow is called based on the success condition of the testflow.

The tests themselves are described as `TestDefinition`s and specify the execution of a test such as the command or the image that should run.
TestDefinitions are described as a Kubernetes resource but are just used as configuration file by the testmachinery.
If a `TestRun` enumerates tests by a label, all `TestDefinition`s that are found in the given locations and match that label are executed in parallel.

The TestMachinery searches the locations in `testrun.spec.testDefLocations` (in the `.test-defs` folder) for the `TestDefinition` (specified by name and label in the testFlow and onExit), executes them with the provided global and local config and mounts the files of the location to the container where the TestDefinition is found.
Accordingly, TestDefinitions do not need to be deployed to the k8s cluster.
They are automatically picked up and parsed by the testmachinery.

Currently there are 2 location types available:

- `git`: searches a remote git respository for `TestDefinition`s (Note: The k8s cluster hosting the TestMachinery has to run in corporate network if git repositories from the internal github are specified)
- `local`: searches a local file path for TestDefinitions

The TestMachinery parses the `TestRun` definition and generates an argo workflow that executes the test flow.
After the argo workflow has finished (either successful or with failure), the TestMachinery collects the results (phase, duration, ...) and updates the status of the `TestRun`.

Furthermore, generated artifacts that are stored in the s3 storage are deleted after the `TestRun` is deleted from the cluster.

## Usage

### Write your own tests (integrate into the testmachinery)

See [docs/GetStarted](docs/GetStarted.md)

### TestMachinery Deployment

1. Setup a k8s cluster (min. Version 1.10.x, preferred Version: 1.12.x, minikube is also suitable)
2. Install prerequisites ([argo](https://github.com/argoproj/argo), [minio](https://www.minio.io/) and the Testrun CRD) with `make install`
    * The default namespace is `default`; another namespace can be defined with `make install NS=namespace-name`
3. Install the TestMachinery with `make install_controller`. Then the controller alongside to a service, validation webhooks and needed rbac permissions is installed.
4. `TestRun`s can be executed by creating them with `kubectl create -f path/to/testrun.yaml` (examples can be found in the [examples folder](examples))

**Prerequisite**: the TestMachinery and the `TestRun`s have to reside in the same namespace due to cross-namespace issues of the argo workflow engine.

### Developing tests locally

`TestRun`s and `TestDefinition`s can be developed locally in a minikube cluster so that no remote installation is needed.
To develop a `TestRun` locally the TestMachinery has to be installed as described in [TestMachinery Deployment](#TestMachinery-Deployment).

If a local `TestDefinition` is developed, the TestMachinery has to be started in _insecure_ mode to mount hostPaths:

- the `TestDefinition` root folder has to be mounted to the minikube cluster with `make mount-local path=path/to/folder`
- the `TestDefinition` itself has to be in the directory `path/to/folder/.test-defs`.
- the TestMachinery itself has to be installed with `make install-controller-local` which starts the controller in _insecure_ mode and mounts the previously specified folder to the controller pod.

### Use private images

Images from private repositories can be used by

1. adding corresponding pull-secrets to the kubernetes cluster (see https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication and https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/)
2. add the name of the created secret to the Testmachinery ConfigMap `tm-config` --> `.data.secrets.PullSecrets`

These secrets can be added during runtime as the testmachinery fetches these secrets for every new run.

### Use with GitHub Authentication

The Testmachinery uses no authentication for GitHub by default.
To enable private repositories or increase the rate limit of GitHub; a GitHub config with an user needs to be added for authentication.
Adding a new GitHub config requires the following steps:

1. Create a GitHub config file in the format:
```
secrets:
    - sshUrl: ssh://git@github.com         // change if you want to add configs for different github enterprise instances
      httpUrl: https://github.com
      apiUrl: https://api.github.com
      disable_tls_validation: true
      webhook_token:
      technicalUser:
        username:
        password:
        emailAddress:
        authToken:
    - ...
```
2. Encode the config file in base64 and the encoded data to config.yaml key in `examples/gh-secrets.yaml`.
3. Deploy the secret into the same namespace as the controller.

Another GitHub instance can be added editing the exiting secret and change the base64 encoded data.

### Testrunner
See testrunner [docs](docs/Testrunner.md)

## Local TestMachinery development

For local development of the TestMachinery itself, the prerequisites from [TestMachinery Deployment](#TestMachinery-Deployment) from step 1 to step 3 have to be performed (skip step 4, we don't want to deploy the TestMachinery controller into the cluster as it should run locally).
Afterwards the controller can be started locally with `make run-local KUBECONFIG=/path/to/.kube/config`.
It is then automatically compiled, started in insecure mode and watches for `TestRun`s in the specified cluster.
